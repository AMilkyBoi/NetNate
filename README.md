*Updated 8 August 2022*
This is a temporary repository for my website development project, NetNate. The current website is deployed using a third-party CSS theme hosted by W3Schools and is much too resource-heavy. I recently set up Hugo, a static site generator, on this repository to usher in a new age for NetNate. Hugo will allow me to maintain a more secure, easy to upgrade, and quicker to load website with full support for custom theming.

## Backend

Hugo sites are primarily written in Markdown (`.md`). This website is hosted on GitHub as a GitHub Pages project. Each time code is pushed to `main`, GitHub Actions builds the site automatically and the content is stored on the `gh-pages` branch. The GitHub Pages site is then built from the `gh-pages` branch.

## Philosophy

Websites today are extremely bloated and more often than not contain copious amounts of unnecessary or downright predatory tracking tools. A good website abides by the following ruleset:

- Free/Libre and Open-Source Software (F/LOSS)
- No tracking tools
- Minimal amounts of JavaScript
- Delivery optimization on any system for any network

Any and all of the information and/or opinions made in this project, during any stage, are and will always be completely free to share and distribute.

## Upgrades

Good motivations are key to any project, but what will this site actually contain? Out of all the improvements that I plan on making to the new website, I am most excited to showcase blog/wiki style pages. These pages will be available for all users to view with the foremost intention of documenting the progress that I have made on various projects throughout the years. I hope that the culmination of knowledge (good and bad) that will eventually be documented on these pages will be useful not only to me, but to anyone who decides to give my website a visit.

## Pages

Below is a tentative list of all the blog/wiki style pages that I plan on implementing on the new website. Not all of these pages will be made immediately, some might never be made, and still others will be made that are not listed here.
